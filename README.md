## Preparation and Installation Instructions

Install the latest version of Ember. See Ember's documentation for step-by-step instructions.

1.  [Fork and clone]
    this repository.
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install` and `bower install`.
1.  Start any API based on a recent version of the [Rails API
    Template](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template) or the
    [Express API
    Template](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/express-api-template).
1.  Start the front-end server with `ember server`.


## Technologies Used

To develop this appilication, I used Ember.js as a front-end framework and Ruby on Rails as a back-end server. Additionally, this app was created using several NPM packages and Bootstrap/SASS for styling.

## Approach

I started the project by focusing on my user storires, my ERD, and scoping my project down to something that I was confident I could accomplish in the alotted time. To start off on the right foot, I deployed both my heroku back-end and the ember auth template. With slightly more experience using Rails than ember, I decided it would be best to get my rails server up and running first. Though it took longer than the last time I used rails, I was able to get all my curl scripts running within a day and a half. I then moved on to my first ember experience.

Similar to how I approached using the browser-template, I first broke ember down into a diagram so that I could at least go into building my application with something to go off of. My first goal was to get phumblr crudding. Unlike using the browser template however, this was much easier with ember, as it seemed to seemelessly pull the data from my server. The 'magic' aspect of Ember certainly caused quite a few mishaps and frustrating bugs, however I am happy I decided to give it a try.


## Major Hurdles/Unsolved Problems

Getting around the ember stuff that I did(and may still) not understand was probably made up the majority of the largest hurdles I made. When I had code that to me looked perfect, or at least should have worked, I spent hours combing through it, only to find that it was one parameter being required in my back-end, or a '/' precedeing my 'page-not-found' route. While I am proud of my ability to learn a front-end framework like Ember, I definitely felt a bit discouraged at certain times throughout the framework-learning proccess. I plan to continue working on this app after GA ends.
